Hi! I am a PhD student at [NUS IORA](https://iora.nus.edu.sg) and was a BEng Industrial Engineering student at [NUS ISE](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/isem/), as well as an exchange student at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/). 

My research interests are in operations research, machine learning and large language models.

I am currently under the guidances of [Professor Qin HanZhang](https://hanzhangqin.com) and [Dr Yang ShanShan](https://www.a-star.edu.sg/artc/home).

In my free time, I enjoy playing music instruments, playing video games (Genshin & Honkai Star Rail), and am an avid [traveller](/travelling).
